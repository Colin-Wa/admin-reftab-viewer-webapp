# admin-reftab-viewer-webapp
Program that shows asset fields in both Google Admin and Reftab. Fields can be changed in both databases simultaneously, and assets can be checked out and back in. User emails options are automatically shown when typing into the checkout field.

Necessary keys and credentials are not included in the public code on Github. Even if they were, the program would not be very useful unless one's asset tracking set up used Google Admin and Reftab fields exactly as they are used in the program. For this reason, there are no setup instructions.
